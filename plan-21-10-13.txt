Steps:
	Add a single "speculator"
	Attempts to determine what the true price is
	Attempts to determine the parameters of the market (mu, nu)
	From there, determines the approximate maximum and minimum prices (just math, but probabilistically)
	From there, buys when price is low and sells when price is high

Tasks:
0) Play around with parameter
1) Add subjective price variation (maybe)

1) Create speculator class
2) Figure out the quantities of interest (for computational DM) and how to model them
3) Implement in code
4) Write the send_bid function. Does not have to send in an order; can choose to hold.
5) Instantiate, test again, see how well the speculator can exploit the irrationality of the other agents.
