Parameters:
	true_price = 100
		Not really a param because scalable system
	
	Buyer subjective price stdev = 0.2
	Buyer asking price stdev = 0.4
	Buyer aggressiveness = 0.01
	
	Seller subjective price stdev = 0.2
	Seller asking price stdev = 0.4
	Seller aggressiveness = 0.01
	
	Market decay time = 20
		This is more of a thing that changes how its plotted
		In the future it will be used by the speculators.
	Market initial volume_commodity and volume_fiat
		This kind of changes the behavior at the beginning
	
	Number of timesteps
	Number of buyers
	Number of sellers
	
	How asking price is updated based on completed transaction or not
		For buyers, we use sigmoid
		For sellers, we use shifted exponential

Assumptions and Simplifications:
	Subjective price never changes
	Aggressiveness never changes
	
	Buyers and sellers have infinite resources
	Buyers and sellers only send in one order per timestep
	There is no risk for buyers or sellers, only potential added value
	Buyers never sell and sellers never buy
	No shorting, calling, or more complex order and option types
	
	Added value is not tracked
	
	The update to the asking price does not factor in:
		The current or past market price
		Past acceptance/rejection of orders
	
	In reality, market exchanges extract a small fee from all transactions
		proportional to the size of the transaction
	
	Also, there is only one commodity to be traded, with nothing outside social knowledge to price it
	
	Buyers and sellers also have no expenses or reasons for possessing either fiat or the commodity
	
	If we allow for big orders, will need to play a matching game with orders

Priority list of assumptions/simplifications to complexify:
Rank 1:
	Added value is not tracked
	Subjective price never changes
	Aggressiveness never changes
	The update to the asking price does not factor in:
		The current or past market price
		Past acceptance/rejection of orders
	There is no risk for buyers or sellers, only potential added value
		Kinda vague
		Includes finite resources, holding resources, uncertain income and expense
		
	
Rank 2:
	Buyers never sell and sellers never buy
	No shorting, calling, or more complex order and option types
	In reality, market exchanges extract a small fee from all transactions
		proportional to the size of the transaction
	
Rank 3:
	Also, there is only one commodity to be traded, with nothing outside social knowledge to price it
	Buyers and sellers only send in one order per timestep
	If we allow for big orders, will need to play a matching game with orders
	How asking price is updated based on completed transaction or not
		For buyers, we use sigmoid
		For sellers, we use shifted exponential
